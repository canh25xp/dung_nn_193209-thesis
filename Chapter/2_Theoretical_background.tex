\section{Front end}

\subsection{HTML}

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is the most widely used language for writing web pages.

HTML is a markup language.
This means using HTML to mark up a text document with tags to instruct the web browser on how to structure it for display on the screen.

HTML can be thought of as helping us create the ``skeleton'' of a website.
Advantages of HTML:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It has abundant support resources within a vast user community
    \item It can smoothly operate on almost all modern web browsers.
    \item HTML markup tags are typically concise and highly consistent.
    \item It is open-source and completely free.
    \item HTML is a web standard governed by the W3C.
    \item It is easy to integrate with various backend languages (e.g. PHP, Node.js, Java, \dots).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CSS}
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a language used to format elements created by markup languages like HTML.
In other words, while HTML structures elements on a website such as headings, tables, and paragraphs, CSS enriches and enhances these HTML elements by styling them, changing text colors, adding background colors, or modifying page layouts.

It can be understood that HTML creates the "skeleton" of a website, while CSS provides the colors, cosmetics, and appearance.

\subsection{JavaScript}

JavaScript is a widely used programming language for websites today, integrated and embedded into HTML to make websites more dynamic.
JavaScript acts as part of a webpage, executing client-side scripts that enable both user-side and server-side (Node.js) functionalities to create dynamic web pages.

JavaScript is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
It is one of the three main languages in web development and has interdependencies to build professional, dynamic websites.

The role of JavaScript is to manipulate HTML objects within the browser.
It can easily intervene in actions such as adding, deleting, or modifying CSS properties and HTML tags.
In other words, JavaScript is a client-side programming language for browsers.

JavaScript can fetch data from the server through APIs returned as JSON strings and display them on the user interface.
It can also retrieve data entered into forms on the interface and call APIs to save the data to the server.

\section{Backend}

\subsection{Java}

Java is one of the object-oriented programming languages used in software development, web applications, games, and mobile applications.
It was initiated by James Gosling and colleagues at Sun Microsystems in 1991, originally named Oak with the purpose of programming consumer electronic devices.

Unlike some other languages that run only in specific environments, Java programs can run effectively in various environments, known as "cross-platform" capability.
This hardware and operating system independence is demonstrated at both the source code and binary levels.

Java is a powerful and versatile programming language capable of developing websites, apps, AI, embedded systems, and more.

Java boasts several outstanding advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It enforces strict data type requirements.
    \item Java tightly controls access to arrays and strings, preventing buffer overflow techniques.
          Thus, accesses do not exceed the size of arrays or strings.
    \item Memory allocation and deallocation processes are handled automatically.
    \item Error handling mechanisms simplify error recovery and management.
          However, Java also has some limitations compared to other languages:
    \item Like other interpreted languages, executing Java code is slower than compiled languages (though within acceptable limits).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Spring framework}

Spring is a Java framework widely used by millions of developers for developing high-performance, easily testable, and reusable code applications.

Spring is an open-source framework developed, shared, and supported by a large community of users.
It is built upon two core design principles: Dependency Injection and Aspect-Oriented Programming.
The core features of Spring can be used to develop Java Desktop, mobile applications, and Java Web applications.
Spring's primary goal is to simplify the development of J2EE applications based on the POJO (Plain Old Java Object) model.

Spring is divided into several modules, each serving different application development purposes.

Benefits of the Spring framework include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Spring allows developers to use POJOs, simplifying work without needing to deal with EJB, application threading, configuration, etc.
    \item Spring is modularly organized.
          Although it consists of many packages and classes, developers only need to focus on what they need, ignoring the rest.
    \item Spring supports various technologies such as ORM Framework, logging frameworks, JEE, scheduling libraries (Quartz and JDK timer), etc.
    \item The Spring Web module is designed based on the MVC pattern, providing comprehensive features that replace other web frameworks like Struts.
\end{itemize}

Spring provides projects like Spring Security, which enhances authentication and authorization mechanisms for projects, ensuring secure user authentication and access control.

Spring Boot: This framework facilitates rapid development and deployment of web applications.

\subsection{Hibernate}

Hibernate is an open-source Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library that helps Java developers write applications by mapping objects (POJOs) to relational database management systems, supporting object-oriented programming concepts with relational databases.

With Hibernate, developers do not need to work directly with the database as they would with JDBC.
Instead, they work with databases through classes that represent tables in the database.
Before Hibernate, developers had to use JDBC to write lengthy and verbose SQL queries, which often resulted in poor performance due to frequent opening and closing of connections.
With Hibernate, developers no longer need to write verbose SQL queries or manage connections manually multiple times.

\section{Database management system (DBSM)}

Database management system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It is a system designed to automatically and systematically manage a specific volume of data.
          Management actions include editing, deleting, storing, and searching (retrieving information) within a defined dataset.
    \item It is a software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve, and manage data within a database.
\end{itemize}

Roles of a Database Management System:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Provides an environment for creating databases: DBMS plays a role in providing users with a data definition language to describe, declare data types, and data structures.
    \item Provides methods for updating and exploiting data: DBMS provides users with a data manipulation language to express requests, update operations, and data exploitation.
          Data operations include Updating (inserting, editing, deleting data), Exploitation (searching, extracting data).
    \item Provides tools to control and manage access to the database to ensure the implementation of basic database requirements.
\end{itemize}

Thanks to its useful functions and high performance, many DBMSs have been developed with the aim of improving data processing capabilities for computer software, websites, etc.

Popular Database Management Systems today include MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, MongoDB, PostgreSQL \dots

For this problem, I choose to use MySQL as the database management system.

MySQL:

\begin{itemize}
    \item One of the most popular databases for web applications.
    \item This DBMS tool allows the selection of multiple storage engines.
    \item User-friendly interface and batch commands.
\end{itemize}

Advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item MySQL is free.
    \item Provides extensive functionality.
    \item Various user interfaces, including web and desktop app versions.
    \item It can operate on other databases like DB2 and Oracle.
\end{itemize}

Disadvantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Requires more time to work with MySQL compared to automated systems.
    \item Does not support XML or OLAP integration.
    \item Support is available in the free version but requires payment for certain features.
\end{itemize}

\section{Tools usec}

    \caption{Tool Postman}
    \label{fig:postman}
\end{figure}

Postman is currently one of the most popular tools used for API testing.
With Postman, you can call Rest APIs without writing any code.

Postman supports all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc\dots)

Additionally, it allows you to save the history of requests, which is very convenient for reuse when needed.

Benefits of using Postman:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Using Collections: Postman allows users to create collections for their API calls.
          Each collection can have subfolders and multiple requests, which helps organize test sets.
    \item Collaboration: Collections and environments can be imported or exported, making it easy to share files.
    \item API Testing: Test the HTTP response status.
    \item Debugging: The Postman console helps check what data has been retrieved, making it easy to debug tests.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visual Paradigm}

Visual Paradigm is a versatile software tool designed for modeling, designing, and managing software projects.
It supports various modeling languages and methodologies, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Key features of Visual Paradigm include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item UML Modeling: Comprehensive support for Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams.
    \item Business Process Modeling: Tools for Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN).
    \item Database Design: Visual tools for designing databases and generating SQL scripts.
    \item Agile and Scrum Support: Features for managing agile development and Scrum projects.

\end{itemize}

\section{Template Engine Thyme leaf}

Thymeleaf is a Java XML/XHTML/HTML5 Template Engine that can work in both web and non-web environments.
It is more suitable for serving XHTML/HTML5 at the View Layer of web applications based on the MVC architecture.
It can process any XML file, even in offline environments.
It fully supports interaction with the Spring Framework.

Thymeleaf can be used as a replacement for JSP at the View Layer of an MVC web application.
Thymeleaf is open-source software licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
Thymeleaf code structure uses pure HTML code and does not employ any non-HTML tags, making it very user-friendly.

Typically, with views used in Java such as JSP or JSF, to see changes in the interface, you have to refresh the web page.
However, with Thymeleaf, you can see changes in the interface without reloading the page, although by default, Thymeleaf cannot handle this issue directly.

\section{Restful API}

\subsection{Define}

API is an intermediary method and protocol for connecting to other libraries and applications.
It stands for Application Programming Interface.
An API is not a programming language; it is simply a set of functions or procedures.
These functions can be written in various programming languages.
APIs provide access to a set of commonly used functions, enabling data exchange between applications.

APIs serve as a bridge between different applications and websites.
Data from a website can be used by software and vice versa.

\subsection{API Works}

\begin{itemize}
    \item First, build the API URL so that third parties can send data requests to the content-providing server via the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
    \item On the content-providing web server, the source applications will perform authentication checks if any, and locate the appropriate resources to create the content for the response.
    \item The server returns the result in JSON or XML format via the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.
    \item At the initial request location, which could be a web or mobile application, the JSON/XML data will be parsed to extract the data.
          After obtaining the data, further actions such as saving it to a database or displaying it are performed.
    \item REST primarily operates based on the HTTP protocol.
          The basic activities mentioned above use specific HTTP methods.
    \item There are four main methods when working with REST APIs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, corresponding respectively to the functions: read, create, update, delete.
\end{itemize}
